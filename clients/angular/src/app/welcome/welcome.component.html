    Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Here's
    another <strong>little happy bush</strong>. Let all these little
    things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. No worries. No
    cares.

    How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your
    challenge
    for the day. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not
    wasted. <strong>Let's get crazy</strong>. At home you have unlimited
    time.
    We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Nothing's gonna make your
    husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered
    dinner.

    This is your world, <strong>whatever makes you happy</strong> you can
    put in
    it. Go crazy. Everybody needs a friend. It's important to me that you're
    happy. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your
    brush like that. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of
    things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics.
    Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow.

    Didn't you know you had that much power? <strong>You can move
    mountains</strong>. You can do anything. Don't kill all your dark areas
    -
    you need them to show the light. It just happens - whether or not you
    worried about it or tried to plan it.
